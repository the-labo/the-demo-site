### First Things You Should Try

When something goes funny, the first thing to do is `clean` and `build`

```bash

# Clean up files and build again (aka. `pon c b`)
pon clean build

```

### Docker Containers Seam to Be Dead

To Re-create docker containers,

```bash

# Remove docker containers and restart again
pon docker:*/remove docker

```
